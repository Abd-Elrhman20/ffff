                <p>a part of astronomy, astrophysics deals with the study of celestial bodies by applying the laws of
                    physics and chemistry. The field applies laws of different subjects like thermodynamics, molecular
                    physics, relativity, particle physics, etc. This book unfolds the innovative aspects of
                    astrophysics, which will be crucial for the holistic understanding of the subject matter.</p>

                <p>Are we alone in the Universe? Was there anything before the Big Bang? Are there other universes? What
                    makes stars shine? Where does Earth's water come from? Why is the night sky dark? Was there ever
                    life on Mars? How do telescopes work? This engaging guide book answers all these questions and
                    hundreds more.</p>

                <p>This second edition of Introduction to Cosmology is an exciting update of an award-winning textbook.
                    It explains modern cosmological concepts, such as dark energy, in the context of the Big Bang
                    theory. Its clear, lucid writing style, with a wealth of useful everyday analogies, makes it
                    exceptionally engaging.</p>

                <p>Award-winning author Peter Bond provides an up to-date, in-depth account of the sun and its family in
                    the 2nd edition of Exploring the Solar System. This new edition brings together the discoveries and
                    advances in scientific understanding made during the last 60 years of solar and planetary
                    exploration.</p>

                <p>Planetary research today is a strongly multidisciplinary endeavor with efforts coming from
                    engineering and natural sciences. This book provides an up-to-date interdisciplinary geoscience
                    focused overview of solid solar system bodies and their evolution, based on the comparative
                    description of processes acting on them.</p>

                <p>In writing this textbook the author's objective was to provide students with a non-trivial,
                    reasonably priced introduction to astronomy. Starting with problems astronomers face on Earth
                    connected with observation, the book then moves on to cover the Solar System, galaxies and finally
                    cosmology.</p>
